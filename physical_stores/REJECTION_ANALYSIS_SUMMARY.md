### 3. MIS-TARGETING (2 rejections - reclassified from "Product Awareness")

#### Rejected Stores:
- **The Mindshop (Gifts from the Heart)** (Pacific Grove, CA)
  - Issue: Doesn't have space, doesn't know what it is, doesn't know how it tastes
  - **This is mis-targeting**: Store wasn't properly researched before visit
  - Should have been identified as not a good fit during research phase

- **Garden Wedding Chapel** (Morro Bay, CA)
  - Issue: "Doesn't sell food here, man it is a bookstore"
  - **This is mis-targeting**: Clearly not a food retailer
  - Should have been filtered out during initial research

#### Key Insights:
- These rejections are **preventable** with better pre-visit research
- Need to verify: product mix, food permit, actual retail capability
- **Not product awareness issues** - these are targeting mistakes

---

  - Issue: Theme not aligned with what they're offering

## Actionable Recommendations

### 1. PRICING STRATEGY
- ✅ **Lead with flexible pricing** - Mention both consignment and purchase options upfront
- ✅ **Ask about markup early** - "What markup do you typically need?" before discussing price
- ✅ **Be transparent** - Show wholesale pricing structure clearly
- ✅ **Offer tiered pricing** - Volume discounts for larger orders

### 2. CONSIGNMENT STRATEGY
- ✅ **Lead with PURCHASE option first** - Many stores prefer this
- ✅ **Mention consignment as alternative** - "We also offer consignment if you prefer"
- ✅ **For stores not set up for consignment** - Don't push it, offer purchase model
- ✅ **Simplify consignment process** - Make paperwork easy if they want it

### 3. TARGETING IMPROVEMENTS
- ✅ **Pre-visit research checklist:**
  - [ ] Verify product mix (not crystal-only, candle-only, etc.)
  - [ ] Check if they sell food/beverages
  - [ ] Verify retail space exists
  - [ ] Check food permit if required
  - [ ] Review website/social media for values alignment
- ✅ **Filter out obvious mismatches** before visiting
- ✅ **Better initial screening** - Don't waste time on bookstores, non-food retailers

### 4. DOCUMENTATION
- ✅ **Always document rejection reason** in Outcome field
- ✅ **Use consistent format**: "Rejected - [specific reason]"
- ✅ **Capture key details**: pricing concerns, space issues, fit problems
- ✅ **Follow up on unclear rejections** - Call back to understand why
